# github-kt

github-kt is a Kotlin/JVM wrapper for the GitHub API. This library focuses on simplicity and Kotlin-first paradigms.
Note that while this is actively maintained, Regression Games is only added API components that we need in our projects
as we need them. Feel free to contribute additional endpoints and objects and make a PR! The currently implemented
components are:

* GitHub Auth Client
  * Request device code for device auth flow
  * Poll device code for authorization status
* GitHub Client
  * Request user profile of logged in user

More coming soon!
